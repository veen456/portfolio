    "The snake game was probably my favorite hack because of its simplicity and ease to make edits. In the end, we made many changes like themes and modes. We even added our own modes like Candied Apples, which has a golden apple that can give you a lot of length. We also added a lot of speed and modes like wall on/off. Since the game was pretty simple, we were able to make a lot of changes and make the game much more fun.\n",

I would say this was one of the hardest hacks because it took a lot of time for me to figure out the alignment and getting the percentage bar to work with the letters. In the end, I think we made a pretty good game and it works well, with different modes and string lengths to use.\n",
