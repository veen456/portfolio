    "    \"### 🏷️ Always Name Your Booleans Clearly\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"Use `is`, `has`, `can` in front of them.\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"**Examples:**\\n\",\n",
    "    \"- `isReady` instead of `ready`\\n\",\n",
    "    \"- `hasValue` instead of `value`\\n\",\n",
    "    \"- `canSubmit` instead of `submit`\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"### 🔄 Use Booleans to Track State\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"Think of booleans as tiny switches:\\n\",\n",
    "    \"- `true` = \\\"on\\\"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"- `false` = \\\"off\\\"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"### 🔄 Reset Booleans When Needed\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"Whenever a new number starts or the user clears the calculator, **reset flags**:\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"A boolean flag is like a tiny sticky note in your program saying \\\"this thing happened\\\" or \\\"this thing is active.\\\"\\n\",\n",

    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"| Flag name | Meaning |\\n\",\n",
    "    \"|-----------|---------|\\n\",\n",
    "    \"| `hasDot` | The current number already has a decimal `.` |\\n\",\n",
    "    \"| `justCalculated` | User just pressed `=` and finished a calculation |\\n\",\n",
    "    \"| `isNegative` | Current number is negative |\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"**⚠️ Important:** When a new number starts or the user presses A/C, these flags may no longer reflect the new number's state.\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"### 🤔 Why resetting is necessary\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"**Example 1:** Suppose the user types 3.5 → `hasDot = true`.\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"If the user presses `+` and starts typing a new number **without resetting** `hasDot`, the calculator thinks the new number **already has a decimal** and won't allow another `.`\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"**Example 2:** After `=` is pressed, `justCalculated = true`.\\n\",\n",
    "    \"\\n\",\n",
    "    \"If the user wants to type a new number, the program needs to know to **start fresh**\\n\",\n",

    "    \"Combine them with `if`, `else` to control behavior\\n\",\n",
